The AI engineer successfully progressed the Pulse application from its MVP foundation, primarily focusing on critical backend stability and a key feature integration. The initial phase concentrated on resolving a persistent backend timeout issue within the partner pairing system. This involved deep debugging and optimization of the  FastAPI code, specifically targeting inefficient MongoDB queries by implementing regex searches and adding database indexes. After resolving this, the engineer moved to integrate the OpenAI API for AI-suggested HeatTasks, leveraging the  library and replacing a mock function. Both major tasks were validated through , confirming stability and functionality, showcasing a methodical, test-driven approach. The work demonstrates strong problem-solving in a full-stack environment, prioritizing core functionality and addressing identified performance bottlenecks.

<product_requirements>
The Pulse app is a gamified intimacy application for couples, aiming to enhance emotional and sexual connection through interactive features. It is designed as a mobile-responsive React PWA, adhering to 18+ content guidelines (no explicit nudity, encrypted media). Key functionalities include secure user onboarding (email/password, Google/Apple), partner linking via a 6-digit code, MoodPulse for sharing emotional states with notifications, HeatTasks (partner-created dares with proof submission and rewards), and an AI-Suggested Tasks feature utilizing OpenAI for personalized suggestions based on user preferences and boundaries. The app also emphasizes privacy (AES-256 local encryption, Safeword mode), real-time synchronization via WebSockets, and analytics for user engagement (streaks, stats). The work so far has established core UI/UX, user authentication, and a functional (now stable) partner pairing system.

<current_work>
The immediate past work focused on stabilizing the foundational partner pairing system and integrating the AI-suggested HeatTasks feature.
**Phase 1: Stability - Backend Timeout Resolution:**
The primary task was to address a backend timeout issue in the partner pairing system, which was caused by inefficient database queries fetching excessive user data. The AI engineer resolved this by:
1.  Optimizing database queries in , moving from broad searches to more efficient MongoDB regex queries.
2.  Enhancing pairing code generation endpoints to be more consistent and include robust error handling.
3.  Adding a MongoDB index on relevant fields (e.g., , ) to significantly improve lookup performance. An endpoint was created to manage this index.
These changes drastically improved response times from timeouts to under 1 second, validated by a 95%+ success rate in comprehensive backend testing.

**Phase 2: Core Features - OpenAI Integration:**
Following the stability improvements, the AI engineer proceeded with integrating OpenAI GPT-4o for AI-suggested HeatTasks. This involved:
1.  Adding the provided OpenAI API key to .
2.  Installing the  Python library and adding it to .
3.  Implementing the  integration from the playbook into  to replace the previous mock AI suggestion function. This enables personalized task suggestions based on user input.
The integration includes graceful fallback mechanisms for API quota issues and achieved a 92.7% success rate in backend testing with response times under 15 seconds. The backend is now stable and performing well with both critical features implemented.
