The AI engineer's work within this trajectory systematically expanded the Pulse application's core functionality and addressed critical usability issues. The initial phase focused on implementing the HeatTask system, including creation, proof submission, and countdown timers, alongside a basic reward/token system and WebSocket-based real-time notifications. This involved extensive modifications to the  backend for new models and API endpoints, and a significant refactor of  on the frontend. A critical backend bug concerning MongoDB ObjectId serialization was identified and thoroughly resolved. Subsequently, the engineer addressed user-reported UI/UX issues, specifically fixing a mismatch in partner pairing code formats (alphanumeric backend vs. numeric frontend expectation) and enhancing the logout/account switching mechanism. The process involved iterative testing, bug fixing, and direct user feedback incorporation, culminating in a stable, feature-rich application.

<product_requirements>
The Pulse app is a gamified intimacy application for couples designed to strengthen emotional and sexual connection. It is built as a mobile-responsive React PWA, strictly adhering to 18+ content guidelines. Core features include secure user onboarding (email/password, Google/Apple), partner linking via a 6-character code, MoodPulse for sharing emotional states with notifications, HeatTasks (partner-created dares with proof submission and rewards), and AI-Suggested Tasks leveraging OpenAI for personalized suggestions. Key non-functional requirements include privacy (AES-256 local encryption, Safeword mode), real-time synchronization via WebSockets, and analytics (streaks, stats). So far, core UI/UX, user authentication, and a stable partner pairing system have been established. The current development enhances HeatTasks, introduces token/reward mechanics, and refines real-time notifications.

<code_architecture>
**High-Level Architecture**: The application follows a typical full-stack architecture, comprising a React-based frontend, a FastAPI backend, and a MongoDB database. Frontend-backend communication utilizes  with an  prefix for backend routes, ensuring proper Kubernetes ingress routing. The backend interacts with MongoDB via .

**Detailed Directory Structure**:


-   
    -   **Summary of importance**: This is the core FastAPI backend, defining API endpoints for user authentication, partner pairing, AI-suggested tasks, and the newly implemented HeatTask and Reward systems. It handles database interactions and JWT authentication.
    -   **Changes made**:
        -   **HeatTask & Rewards**: Implemented new Pydantic models (e.g., , ) and corresponding API endpoints for task creation, proof submission (photo-only), task approval/rejection, token management (earning, spending), and reward creation/redemption.
        -   **Real-time Notifications**: Integrated WebSocket logic for real-time alerts related to HeatTasks and rewards.
        -   **Database Optimization/Fixes**: Resolved a critical MongoDB ObjectId serialization error by ensuring  fields were properly projected to strings (UUIDs or ) across various endpoints (e.g., pairing, user authentication, HeatTask, and Reward related queries). Added and updated MongoDB indexes for new collections and improved query performance.
-   
    -   **Summary of importance**: This is the main React component, managing application state, routing, user authentication, and rendering the UI for various features, including the new HeatTask and Reward systems.
    -   **Changes made**:
        -   **HeatTask UI**: Implemented components for displaying task lists (pending, completed, expired), task detail pages with countdown timers, photo proof submission, and approval/rejection flows.
        -   **Token & Rewards UI**: Added components for displaying token balance, a reward vault (create, view, redeem rewards), and redemption confirmations.
        -   **Notifications**: Integrated WebSocket client-side logic to display real-time toast notifications for new tasks, expiring tasks, proof submissions, and reward redemptions.
        -   **Dashboard Refactor**: The  component was extensively rewritten to incorporate the new HeatTask, Reward, and notification features, along with 3-tab navigation (Moods, Tasks, Rewards).
        -   **UI/UX Fixes**:
            -   Modified pairing code input to accept 6-character alphanumeric input and updated validation logic ().
            -   Removed debug information () from the pairing screen UI.
            -   Enhanced logout functionality by making the button more explicit (Logout) and adding a Switch Account button on the pairing screen for better multi-user testing.
-   
    -   **Summary of importance**: Stores environment variables for the backend, critical for database connection and external API keys.
    -   **Changes made**: (Initially, before this trajectory) The OpenAI API key was added. No explicit changes within this trajectory.

<current_work>
The immediate past work, spanning this trajectory, has successfully brought the Pulse application to a production-ready state with a complete HeatTask and Rewards system. Initially, the focus was on implementing core backend logic for HeatTasks, including task creation, proof submission, and approval workflows, along with token earning/spending and reward management. A significant challenge addressed was the persistent MongoDB ObjectId serialization error, which caused 500 errors across various endpoints; this was fixed by ensuring proper string conversion and projection for  fields. Concurrently, WebSocket-based real-time notifications for task and reward events were integrated.

On the frontend, the React application () was heavily updated to support these new backend features. This included building dedicated UI components for HeatTask lists, detail views with countdown timers, photo proof submission, and the entire token/reward vault experience. A major rewrite of the  component integrated these new features under a 3-tab navigation system.

Crucially, the AI engineer also addressed two critical usability issues identified during testing:
1.  **Pairing Code Mismatch**: The backend was generating 6-character alphanumeric codes (e.g., AD43BA), but the frontend validation expected only 6-digit numeric codes, leading to the Link with Partner button being disabled. The fix involved updating the frontend to accept and validate alphanumeric input, aligning with the backend's generation.
2.  **Logout/Account Switching**: The previous logout mechanism was unclear. The engineer implemented a clear Logout button and a Switch Account option on the pairing screen, coupled with proper token clearing, enabling seamless multi-user testing.

All implemented features and fixes have been thoroughly validated by automated backend and frontend testing agents, confirming high success rates and functionality. The application now delivers a complete user journey from registration and pairing to MoodPulse, HeatTask creation, proof/approval, token/reward management, and real-time interactions.
