The AI engineer successfully initiated the development of the Pulse intimacy app, focusing on delivering a quick aha moment by prioritizing core features. This involved a strategic decision to build a React (PWA) frontend with a FastAPI backend and MongoDB, instead of the initially suggested Flutter, due to environment constraints and faster MVP delivery. The development proceeded iteratively, starting with a bulk code write for the foundational UI and backend, followed by crucial debugging cycles. The main challenge encountered was stabilizing the partner pairing system, which required several fixes in the  (FastAPI backend) due to BSON encoding errors, asynchronous function handling, and API routing. The engineer diligently used  and manual  commands to identify and resolve these issues. As of the last interaction, the pairing system is confirmed to be functional, and the app's UI is well-implemented. A remaining backend timeout issue was noted in the final test report.

<product_requirements>
The Pulse app is a private, gamified intimacy application for couples, designed for emotional and sexual connection through mood sharing, timed dares (HeatTasks), and shared rewards. It targets mobile platforms (initially as a mobile-responsive React PWA) and must comply with app store adult-content guidelines (18+ age gate, no explicit nudity, encrypted media, clean design). Key features include user onboarding via email/password or Google/Apple login, partner linking using a 6-digit code, MoodPulse for sharing current moods (with intensity sliders and push notifications), HeatTasks (partner-created dares with proof submission and rewards), a Reward Vault for redeeming tokens earned from tasks, and AI-Suggested Tasks (using OpenAI) tailored to user preferences and boundaries. The app emphasizes privacy (AES-256 local encryption, user-set boundaries, Safeword mode), real-time sync via WebSockets, and analytics for streaks and stats.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend**: React (PWA, mobile-responsive)
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python)
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Real-time Sync**: WebSockets (FastAPI-Websocket implementation)
- **Push Notifications**: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) & Web Push (VAPID)
- **AI**: OpenAI (GPT-4o for task suggestions)
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Media Storage**: S3/Cloudflare R2 (for proof files, via pre-signed URLs)
- **Local Encryption**: AES-256 (planned for media vault)
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
**High-Level Architecture**: The application is a full-stack system comprising a React frontend and a FastAPI backend, both interacting with a MongoDB database. Frontend API calls strictly use , and all backend API routes are prefixed with . MongoDB interactions on the backend use .

**Detailed Directory Structure**:


-   
    -   **Summary of importance**: This file is the core of the FastAPI backend. It defines the API endpoints for user authentication, registration, partner pairing, and will eventually handle mood logging, task creation, and rewards. It includes database models for users, couples, moods, tasks, and rewards, and implements JWT-based authentication.
    -   **Changes made**: Initially entirely rewritten to establish the base API structure and models. Subsequent significant changes were made to fix the partner pairing system, including:
        -   Correcting the invocation of the  function (e.g., adding parentheses ).
        -   Resolving BSON encoding errors related to MongoDB object IDs by ensuring proper serialization/deserialization.
        -   Adjusting the  endpoint logic to correctly process and link user accounts using pairing codes.
        -   Modifying user registration/login responses to correctly handle  and remove sensitive data like pairing codes from initial auth responses.
-   
    -   **Summary of importance**: This is the primary React component that renders the entire user interface. It manages routing between different views (login, registration, dashboard), user state, and handles interactions for features like partner linking and will eventually support mood selection and task display.
    -   **Changes made**: Initially entirely rewritten to set up the foundational UI, including a login/registration screen with a clean design. Subsequent updates involved adapting the frontend logic to align with the backend's fixed pairing system, ensuring correct API calls for code generation and linking.
-   
    -   **Summary of importance**: This file contains the CSS styles for the React application, likely leveraging Tailwind CSS. It defines the visual appearance, including the gradient backgrounds and component styling.
    -   **Changes made**: Initially entirely rewritten to provide the base styling for the application's gorgeous and clean UI, as per the product requirements.

<current_work>
The current work has focused on establishing the core foundation of the Pulse application. The React frontend is set up, loading a functional and aesthetically pleasing login/registration UI. The FastAPI backend is running and healthy. The most significant progress and debugging effort have been concentrated on the partner pairing system. Initially, this feature was buggy, leading to API errors (404s, 500s) and BSON encoding issues. Through iterative fixes to  (correcting  function calls, MongoDB interactions, and routing) and  (to align with backend changes), the pairing code generation and linking functionality are now working. Users can register, log in, and generate/link with partner codes. The application's UI looks gorgeous, and 95% of the initial end-to-end testing has passed. However, the latest test report indicates a remaining backend timeout in the pairing system, suggesting a lingering performance or stability issue within this critical flow.
